html5app-photo-template
=======================

This is an HTML5 app builded with Construct 2. The purpose was to allow anyone
to take pictures and send them to a server - in this case, authorities.

It was an app case-study for public usage.

With a normal HTML5 browser, it worked great. Unfortunatly, it seems that
PhoneGap do not use standard HTML5 code for pictures, so it is impossible to
pack it as a mobile app :(
